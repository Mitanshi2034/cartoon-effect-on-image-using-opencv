🎨 Cartoon Effect on Image using OpenCV
📌 Project Overview

This project applies a cartoon effect to images using OpenCV in Python. The program transforms a normal image into a cartoon-style image by combining edge detection, noise reduction, and color smoothing techniques.

It demonstrates practical implementation of computer vision and image processing concepts such as bilateral filtering, adaptive thresholding, and image masking.

🚀 Features

Convert any image into a cartoon-style image

Edge detection using adaptive thresholding

Noise reduction with median blur

Color smoothing using bilateral filtering

Simple and easy-to-understand Python implementation

Real-time preview (if webcam is used)

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

🧠 How It Works

Load Image – Read the input image using OpenCV.

Convert to Grayscale – Simplifies the image for edge detection.

Apply Median Blur – Reduces noise.

Detect Edges – Using adaptive thresholding.

Apply Bilateral Filter – Smoothens colors while preserving edges.
📚 Learning Outcomes

Understanding image processing fundamentals

Working with OpenCV functions

Combining multiple image processing techniques

🔮 Future Improvements

Add GUI using Tkinter or Streamlit

Add real-time webcam cartoon effect

Add multiple cartoon styles

Deploy as a web app

Combine Edges & Color Image – Produces final cartoon effect.
